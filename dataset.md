# Pig Dataset Overview

This dataset contains video frames of pigs under various conditions. The dataset is divided into the following categories:

### 1. **pig_normal**
- **Description**: This set contains video frames where the lighting, duration, and symmetry are all normal.
- **Number of frames to extract**: 380
- **Links**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xHbp1YZqnJeikelncb89er9RZXIX53Uj?usp=drive_link

### 2. **pig_low_light**
- **Description**: This set has slightly darker lighting compared to the normal condition, but all other aspects (duration, symmetry) remain unchanged.
- **Number of frames to extract**: 380

### 3. **pig_short**
- **Description**: This set contains fewer frames (shorter video duration), while other conditions remain normal.
- **Number of frames to extract**: 353

### 4. **pig_shaky_hands**
- **Description**: A dataset with significant hand shaking, used to test model
performance under unstable conditions.
- **Number of frames to extract**: 369
